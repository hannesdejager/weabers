# WEABERS

Weabers is a PHP enabled web server and web browser combined into one single application. 

This repository contains the source code for this old Windows app that is still available to download for free from a lot of shareware sites on the Internet.

I used to give this description to the download sites:


> Weabers stand for Web Application Browser and Server.

> It is a PHP and LUA enabled Webserver and Web browser combined into one single executable file. 

> It can be used as a execution framework for offline web based desktop applications. Design your desktop applications with proven web standards like HTML, CSS, Javascript, XML etc. Add some AJAX concepts and execute it in Weabers. 

> Weabsers let you run web based applications without a web server or a browser, just a single application to make your web based software look like a normal desktop application.
